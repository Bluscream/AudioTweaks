## Configuration:
* **DSP Buffer Size:** Samples to keep "buffered" before playback. Higher values fix issues with Bluetooth devices.
* **Swap Channels:** Swaps the left and right audio channel outputs.
* **Force Mono:** Combine both audio channels into a single output.
* **Channel Pan:** Determines how to balance the left and right audio channels.
